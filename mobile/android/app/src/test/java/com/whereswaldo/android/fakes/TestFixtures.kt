 * example values) — avoids re-declaring the same plan-limits object in every fake/test.
 *
 * A5 addition (specs/005-temporary-groups.md §4): the four group-era limits plus `flags.groups`
 * default to `null`/`false` so every pre-A5 call site is unaffected; groups tests pass
 * `groupsFlag = true` (and the specific limits they need) explicitly. */
