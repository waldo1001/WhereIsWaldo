/** The single Activity (Compose Navigation pattern, specs/003-android-client.md §12). Registers
 * itself with [AppContainer] as the current foreground Activity (specs/006-phone-auth.md §6,
 * specs/003 §7) — `FirebaseAuthProvider`'s phone verification needs a live `Activity` for Play
 * Integrity / reCAPTCHA app verification.
 *
 * **A6 addition** (specs/007-public-join-links.md, specs/003-android-client.md §12.3): the
 * launching `Intent`'s `data` `Uri` is checked once, here, against this app's configured
 * `https://{JOIN_LINK_HOST}/g#CODE` join-link shape via [GroupJoinHttpsLinkParser] — deliberately
 * *not* through Navigation Compose's own `navDeepLink` URI-pattern matching (used below this class
 * for the `waldo://group-join?code=…` link), since that matching is path/query-argument based and
 * the join code lives in the URL **fragment** (007 §1), read directly via `Uri.getFragment()`. The
 * parsed [GroupJoinHttpsLinkParser.Result] is then handed to [WaldoNavHost] once, at composition;
 * its own `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` performs the one-time navigation, so this never re-fires on later
 * *in-app* navigation back to [com.whereswaldo.android.ui.nav.Destinations.GroupJoin] (re-checking
 * the live `Activity.intent` from inside the nav graph itself would have exactly that staleness
 * bug, since `Activity.intent` doesn't change on in-app `NavController.navigate()` calls).
 *
 * **Code-review fix (2026-07-22):** the parsing above is additionally guarded by
 * `savedInstanceState == null` — i.e. routed through [GroupJoinHttpsLinkParser.parseIfFreshLaunch]
 * rather than [GroupJoinHttpsLinkParser.parse] directly. Without this, rotation, a dark/light-mode
 * toggle, multi-window resize, a font-scale/locale change, or process-death restore all recreate
 * this Activity with a **fresh** `onCreate` (and so a fresh [WaldoNavHost] composition, and so a
 * fresh `LaunchedEffect(Unit)`) while `getIntent()` keeps handing back the exact same original
 * launch `Uri` — so a user who tapped the https link, landed on `GroupJoin`, then navigated
 * elsewhere (e.g. Settings), would get forcibly yanked back to `GroupJoin` by the next rotation.
 * `savedInstanceState` is non-null on precisely those recreations (the system only supplies it
 * when restoring previously-saved state) and null on a genuinely new launch — the standard Android
 * idiom for "handle this Intent once, not on every recreation." */
