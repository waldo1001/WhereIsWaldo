 * Pure matcher for the public `https://{JOIN_LINK_HOST}/g#{CODE}` join link (specs/007-public-
 * join-links.md §1/§4, specs/003-android-client.md §12.3). Takes plain `String?` URI components
 * rather than `android.net.Uri` so it's testable in a plain JVM JUnit test (specs/003 §14's
 * no-Robolectric/no-instrumented-test convention) — [com.whereswaldo.android.MainActivity] is the
 * one caller that extracts these from a real `Uri` via `.scheme`/`.host`/`.path`/`.fragment`
 * (`android.net.Uri.getFragment()` — **not** `.query`: 007 §1 is explicit the join code travels in
 * the URL **fragment**, never the path or query string, so it's never sent to a server/CDN/proxy
 * and never appears in a log by construction).
 *
 * This is a deliberately different mechanism from the existing `waldo://group-join?code=…` deep
 * link, which is matched automatically by Navigation Compose's `navDeepLink { uriPattern = … }`
 * query-argument placeholder syntax (see `WaldoNavHost.kt`) — that placeholder syntax only covers
 * path/query segments, not URL fragments, so the https link is matched by this explicit function
 * instead, called once from `MainActivity` against the launching `Intent`.

     * fresh `LaunchedEffect(Unit)` — on rotation, dark/light-mode toggle, multi-window resize,

     * forcibly yanked back to `GroupJoin` by the next rotation, since the recreated Activity would
     * re-parse the same still-matching link and re-trigger the one-time navigation.
     *
     * [com.whereswaldo.android.MainActivity] calls this with `isFreshLaunch = (savedInstanceState

     * config-change/process-death recreation" (the system only supplies a non-null
     * `savedInstanceState` when restoring previously-saved state, which is exactly the set of
     * recreations listed above). On a recreation this unconditionally returns [Result.NoMatch]
     * regardless of how well-formed the (already-handled, now-stale) `Uri` still is, so the
     * one-time navigation fires **at most once per genuinely new launch**, not once per
     * recreation.
