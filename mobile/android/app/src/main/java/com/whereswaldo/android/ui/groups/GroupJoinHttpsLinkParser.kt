/**
 * Pure matcher for the public `https://{JOIN_LINK_HOST}/g#{CODE}` join link (specs/007-public-
 * join-links.md §1/§4, specs/003-android-client.md §12.3). Takes plain `String?` URI components
 * rather than `android.net.Uri` so it's testable in a plain JVM JUnit test (specs/003 §14's
 * no-Robolectric/no-instrumented-test convention) — [com.whereswaldo.android.MainActivity] is the
 * one caller that extracts these from a real `Uri` via `.scheme`/`.host`/`.path`/`.fragment`
 * (`android.net.Uri.getFragment()` — **not** `.query`: 007 §1 is explicit the join code travels in
 * the URL **fragment**, never the path or query string, so it's never sent to a server/CDN/proxy
 * and never appears in a log by construction).
 *
 * This is a deliberately different mechanism from the existing `waldo://group-join?code=…` deep
 * link, which is matched automatically by Navigation Compose's `navDeepLink { uriPattern = … }`
 * query-argument placeholder syntax (see `WaldoNavHost.kt`) — that placeholder syntax only covers
 * path/query segments, not URL fragments, so the https link is matched by this explicit function
 * instead, called once from `MainActivity` against the launching `Intent`.
