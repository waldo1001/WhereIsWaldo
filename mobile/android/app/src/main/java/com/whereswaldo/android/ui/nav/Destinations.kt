/**
 * Route string constants (specs/003-android-client.md §12). [Home]/[Map]/[History]/[Geofences]/
 * [Locate]/[Settings] were reserved in A1 and are wired to real screens in A2; [Invites] is a new
 * A2 addition (§3.3/§3.4) — additive, same convention as the rest. A5 additively adds the groups
 * destinations below (specs/005-temporary-groups.md).
 *
 * [Locate] carries no path argument: the target member is passed via [WaldoNavHost]'s own
 * `remember`-held selection state (set by [com.whereswaldo.android.ui.map.MapScreen]'s
 * `onSelectMember`) rather than a nav-graph path segment, deliberately — at the time A2 wrote
 * this, the app had no external deep-link entry points, so there was nothing to gain from a
 * `{userId}` path template (and everything to lose from hand-rolling percent-encoding for a
 * `displayName` that may contain spaces, without a toolchain here to compile-verify it). A5 adds
 * this app's first external deep link ([GroupJoin]'s `waldo://group-join`), but its payload (an
 * 8-char Crockford-base32 code, 001 §1.4) has no such encoding risk — see [GroupDetail]'s doc for
 * why a real `{groupId}` path argument is fine there too.
