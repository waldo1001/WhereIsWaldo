/**
 * Maps every [ApiError] to a short, friendly, user-facing string — **never** [ApiError.message]
 * itself (001-api-contract.md §1.3: "`message`, debug text, never shown raw to users"; §10:
 * "clients map `code` → localized UX"). Mirrors the iOS client's
 * `Networking/APIError+UserMessage.swift`. Kept in one place so it's a single edit point for
 * future localization (today: hardcoded English, matching the rest of this client's literals,
 * e.g. `ui/home/HomeScreen.kt`).
 *
 * [ApiError.message] remains available for logs/debugging only — every `<Feature>StateHolder`
 * must render [userMessage] (via `WaldoErrorState`/`WaldoStatusChip`/etc.), never the raw field.
