 * Pure group-join-code normalizer/validator (001-api-contract.md §1.4), applied to **every**
 * incoming code before it is used — both the manual entry field on [GroupJoinScreen] and, more
 * importantly, the `waldo://group-join?code=…` deep link's `code` query parameter, which is
 * **untrusted external input** (any app on the device, or a malicious link, can launch it with an
 * arbitrary string). Mirrors [com.whereswaldo.android.auth.PhoneNumberNormalizer]'s shape: a plain
 * `object` with a single `normalize`-style function returning `null` on anything that doesn't fit
 * — callers MUST NOT make a network call (or otherwise trust the value) when this returns `null`.
 *
 * Wire format (001 §1.4): 8 characters of Crockford base32 (digits `0-9` plus `A-Z` **minus**
 * `I`/`L`/`O`/`U`, to avoid visual ambiguity). Canonical form is uppercase, no hyphen; clients MAY
 * display/accept the `XXXX-XXXX` grouping and the server ignores case/hyphens — so this sanitizer
 * strips whitespace and hyphens and upper-cases before validating, exactly mirroring the server's
 * own acceptance rule, then rejects anything that still isn't exactly 8 valid characters.
