/// I7 hardening (docs/implementation-handoff.md "Known follow-ups": iOS `verificationID` stored in
/// `UserDefaults`, not Keychain) — the real `KeychainStoring` implementation, backed by the
/// `Security` framework's generic-password Keychain item type. Lives in the app target, not
/// `WaldoKit` (see `KeychainStoring`'s doc comment for why), so it is verified via `swiftc
/// -typecheck` against the built `WaldoKit` module rather than a real `swift test` run.
///
/// Accessibility: `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` — the item (a) is only readable
/// while the device is unlocked (matches its lifetime: it only needs to exist between "start phone
/// verification" and "confirm code", both foreground user actions), (b) is excluded from iCloud
/// Keychain sync and from the *data* restored to a **different** device from an encrypted backup —
/// appropriate for a value that is meaningless off the device that started the verification (it is
/// a Firebase session handle, not a durable credential). This is at least as strict as the
/// `UserDefaults` storage it replaces (plaintext, no accessibility restriction at all), never
/// weaker, so this migration cannot introduce a "worse than before" persistence-across-reinstall
/// behavior.
