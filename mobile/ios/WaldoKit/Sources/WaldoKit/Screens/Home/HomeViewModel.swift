/// specs/004-ios-client.md I2/§3.4 — the post-sign-in hub. Loads just enough family context
/// (`GET /families/me`) to know the caller's role (parent vs member) and offer sensible defaults
/// (own history, first other member to locate), so individual feature screens don't each need to
/// re-derive this.
///
/// **Family-less is first-class (review-gate finding #3, specs/005 §1, 001 §1.5).** A signed-in
/// user without a family answers `FAMILY_NOT_FOUND` (has a profile, no family) or
/// `PROFILE_NOT_FOUND` (brand-new, no profile at all yet — 001 §1.5.3) to this fetch — both land in
/// `.familyless`, a distinct renderable state, NOT the generic `.error`, so `HomeScreen` can still
/// offer Groups (family-independent, 001 §1.5.4) instead of a dead end with a bare error banner.
/// Every other failure (transport, decoding, any other server code) still lands in `.error`.
