// specs/001 §4.3 — update device settings. Pure domain logic: no Azure/Google imports.
//
// Role matrix (§4.3): a parent may set any field of any family device; a non-parent owner
// (member role, in a family) may set only pushToken on their OWN device — any other field
// is AUTH_FORBIDDEN, and so is targeting a device they don't own; a family-less owner may
// set any field of their own device (no family => no parent => the user is their own admin,
// §1.5 step 4). Devices are keyed by ownerUserId, not familyId (002 §2.4, B8 re-key): the
// device is first looked up in the CALLER's own partition (covers the common case — own
// device, any role); only when that misses AND the caller has a family do we fan out across
// every family member's partition (src/domain/family/deviceFanout.ts) to find a device that
// belongs to someone else — the only way a parent can reach another member's device. A
// family-less caller never has a family to fan out over, so they can never even reference
// another user's deviceId (DEVICE_NOT_FOUND).
