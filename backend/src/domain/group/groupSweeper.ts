// specs/002 §2.13/§4.1, specs/005 §2.4 — the daily group sweeper: the project's first
// timer-triggered function's pure domain logic. Walks the `GroupExpiry` date-bucket index
// for the 45-day catch-up window `[today − 45 … today]` (46 tiny partition scans — the
// window "generously covers groupGraceDays plus any outage backlog", never a full table
// scan), and applies each due group's expiry-policy deletion rules. Re-derives everything
// fresh from `Groups.meta` on every row via the same `deriveGroupState` pure function every
// API read path uses (005 §2.2), rather than trusting the row's own `action` label (that
// field is a diagnostic label only — the spec's per-row algorithm never branches on it) —
// this is what makes a partially-failed PATCH-time move, a partially-failed sweeper
// hard-delete, or re-running over the same bucket all self-healing/idempotent by
// construction (002 §2.13, §4.1's crash-recovery notes). Pure domain logic: no Azure/Google
// imports; the function file (groupSweeper.functions.ts) stays a thin timer registration.
