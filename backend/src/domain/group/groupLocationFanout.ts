// specs/001 §5.1 group fan-out side effect + specs/002 §2.12 `GroupLastKnown`. Pure domain
// logic: no Azure/Google imports. Mirrors src/domain/family/deviceFanout.ts's role for the
// family-scoped path — centralizes the "which of my groups get this fix" fan-out so
// reportLocations.ts doesn't reimplement it. After the reporter's own last-known is
// upserted (independently of whether THAT write actually changed anything), the same
// only-newer rule is applied per-group: a group's stored position is a completely separate
// row from the family LastKnown row, with its own recordedAt to compare against.
//
// Active-only (005 §2.2 — grace/ended/archived/expired groups never receive updates once
// endsAt has passed, even during grace) and position-only (005 §3 — no deviceId, batteryPct,
// source, altitude/speed/bearing; only what 002 §2.12 lists).
